## Problem description
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the second leading cause of death globally, and is responsible for approximately 11% of all deaths.
This data set is used to predict whether a patient is likely to have a stroke based on input parameters such as age, heart_disease, hypertension, avg_glucose_level and smoking status. The dataset size is 5110 rows, where each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient, and 12 columns, each providing a different feature.

In this project, an ML model predicts the risk likelihood (the possibility of a potential risk occurring, interpreted using qualitative values such as low, medium, or high) of a stroke for a patient based on age, heart disease, hypertension, avg_glucose_level, and smoking status; these five features were found after EDA to be the most features that tell more on the risk of a stroke for patients. With accuracy of 86% that can be further improved by more feature egineering and ML paramter tuning.

(Note: Feature engineering refers to manipulation — addition, deletion, combination, mutation — of your data set to improve machine learning model training, leading to better performance and greater accuracy.)

With an increased synergy between technology and medical diagnosis, caregivers create opportunities for better patient management by systematically mining and archiving the patients’ medical records. Therefore, by deploying this ML model in the deployment process, the hospitals can use this ML service by estimating the likelihood of a stroke for their patients and taking the necessary action.
